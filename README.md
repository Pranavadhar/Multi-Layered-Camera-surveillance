This project proposes a multi-layered IoT-based security system for robust access control, using Firebase as
the database. It starts with basic surveillance via an ESP32 camera, followed by two-factor authentication
using RFID and fingerprint scanning, and facial recognition as the third layer. A master website monitors
entry, displaying login times for each level fetched from Firebase, and the final layer includes manual
verification by a supervisor.

<h1>NOTE: THE LAYER OF CAMERA SURVILLANCE WHICH I HAVE WORKED WITH IS UPLOADED HERE.
